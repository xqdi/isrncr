% Change log: 
%
%   April 3, 2015 (NB):
%       Works with the new StoreDB class system.
%
%   Aug. 2, 2018 (NB):
%       The value of the cost function is now always cached.
%
%   Sep. 6, 2018 (NB):
%       If the gradient is computed too (because we had to call costgrad
%       with the store as input as per the user's request), then the
%       gradient is also cached.

    
    % Allow omission of the key, and even of storedb.
    if ~exist('key', 'var')
        if ~exist('storedb', 'var')
            storedb = StoreDB();

          % Contrary to most similar functions, here, we get the store by
          % default. This is for the caching functionality described below.
          store = storedb.getWithShared(key);

          % If the cost function has been computed before at this point (and its
          % memory is still in storedb), then we just look up the value.
